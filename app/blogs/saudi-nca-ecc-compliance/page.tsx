                  </h3>
                  <p className="mb-4 text-base font-medium leading-relaxed text-body-color sm:text-lg sm:leading-relaxed lg:text-base lg:leading-relaxed xl:text-lg xl:leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>1. Governance and Risk Management:</strong> The ECC framework emphasizes the importance of establishing strong cybersecurity governance structures and comprehensive risk management processes. Organizations are required to implement formal risk assessment methodologies, develop cybersecurity policies, and establish clear roles and responsibilities for cybersecurity oversight.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4 text-base font-medium leading-relaxed text-body-color sm:text-lg sm:leading-relaxed lg:text-base lg:leading-relaxed xl:text-lg xl:leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>2. Asset Management:</strong> Proper identification, classification, and management of information assets form the foundation of effective cybersecurity. The framework requires organizations to maintain comprehensive asset inventories, implement asset classification systems, and establish appropriate protection measures based on asset sensitivity.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4 text-base font-medium leading-relaxed text-body-color sm:text-lg sm:leading-relaxed lg:text-base lg:leading-relaxed xl:text-lg xl:leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>3. Access Control:</strong> The ECC framework provides detailed guidance on implementing robust access control mechanisms, including user authentication, authorization, and privilege management. Organizations must ensure that access to systems and data is properly controlled, monitored, and regularly reviewed.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-10 text-base font-medium leading-relaxed text-body-color sm:text-lg sm:leading-relaxed lg:text-base lg:leading-relaxed xl:text-lg xl:leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>4. Cybersecurity Operations:</strong> This component focuses on the operational aspects of cybersecurity, including security monitoring, incident response, vulnerability management, and business continuity. Organizations are required to establish security operations centers (SOCs), implement continuous monitoring capabilities, and develop comprehensive incident response plans.
                  </p>

                    Implementation Strategy for Organizations:
                  </h3>
                  <p className="mb-4 text-base font-medium leading-relaxed text-body-color sm:text-lg sm:leading-relaxed lg:text-base lg:leading-relaxed xl:text-lg xl:leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>Phase 1: Assessment and Gap Analysis</strong><br />
                    The first step in ECC compliance implementation involves conducting a comprehensive assessment of the organization's current cybersecurity posture against the ECC framework requirements. This includes identifying gaps, assessing risks, and prioritizing implementation efforts based on business impact and regulatory requirements.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4 text-base font-medium leading-relaxed text-body-color sm:text-lg sm:leading-relaxed lg:text-base lg:leading-relaxed xl:text-lg xl:leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>Phase 2: Policy and Framework Development</strong><br />
                    Organizations must develop and implement comprehensive cybersecurity policies, procedures, and frameworks that align with ECC requirements. This includes establishing cybersecurity governance structures, defining roles and responsibilities, and creating documentation that supports compliance efforts.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4 text-base font-medium leading-relaxed text-body-color sm:text-lg sm:leading-relaxed lg:text-base lg:leading-relaxed xl:text-lg xl:leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>Phase 3: Technical Controls Implementation</strong><br />
                    This phase focuses on implementing the technical security controls specified in the ECC framework. Organizations must deploy appropriate security technologies, configure systems according to security baselines, and establish monitoring capabilities to ensure continuous protection of information assets.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-10 text-base font-medium leading-relaxed text-body-color sm:text-lg sm:leading-relaxed lg:text-base lg:leading-relaxed xl:text-lg xl:leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>Phase 4: Continuous Monitoring and Improvement</strong><br />
                    ECC compliance is not a one-time project but an ongoing process. Organizations must establish continuous monitoring mechanisms, conduct regular security assessments, and continuously improve their cybersecurity posture based on emerging threats and changing business requirements.
                  </p>
